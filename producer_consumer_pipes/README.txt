Section 3


Please type "make" to the console and you can run my bilshell version.
The interactive mode and batch mode partially works, the program
receives a segmentation fault with N values less than or equal to 10. 
I presume this is a faulty implementation of mine in bilshell.c while processing
strings. I am sorry to report that I could not find all my errors.
in the producer / consumer mode, as M tends to get larger, I also
get segmentation fault. 

As I think honesty is the best policy, I assume I will not get a
very good grade but an acceptable one because I learned how to
use execvp and pipes. Also I did not invoke the program direcly 
like "bilshell", but I still use the "./" command to run.
